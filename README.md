This is the github repository that I have to share all the stuff I've found over the years, from websites that help with school to emulators for videogames.  
School/learning
Slader https://www.slader.com/  Slader is a website where you can look up a book and it can show you how to work through homework problems and it's solutions, it doesn't have everything, however it had most of the books I tried.  While I do not recommend you to use it for exclusively everything (you have to learn somehow through work), it is something that I used in order to check my math homework and see where I was going wrong in the problem.

Wolframalpha https://www.wolframalpha.com/  Best math calculator that you can use online for free.

Khanacademy https://www.khanacademy.org/ One of the best online learning programs, videoes on practically any subject and explained like you're five and in a simple way (which is something I personally needed at times)

Duolingo https://www.duolingo.com/ One of the best language learning websites (and yes it even includes some fictional languages).

Paperrater https://www.paperrater.com/free_paper_grader Copy/paste your paper into the textbox and it will critique it in various gramatical fields.  Good for getting a first (not final, just in case) look at a paper that you are writing.

Life
Avast passwords https://www.avast.com/passwords#pc Best free password manager, so that you don’t have just one password for everything which can cause numerous problems.

Waze Smartphone app, crowdsourced googlemaps, which shows details of upcoming traffic based on people inputting (accidents, police officers, red light cameras, etc)

20minutemail https://www.20minutemail.com/ temporary email maker so that you don’t get a bunch of spam when you sign up for some item for a simple task.

Fatfingers http://fatfingers.com/ Fatfingers is how you can search on ebay for misspelled items, letting you sometimes get deals cause people can’t find them.

Adblocker Ublock Origin https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm Best adblocker for chrome and firefox.

Discord/google hangouts https://discordapp.com/ Discord is the best non-video call app, while google hangouts is the best video conference call.

NordVPN https://nordvpn.com/special/brand/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_campaign=off129&utm_source=aff614 My pick for the best VPN out there for privacy and security.  


Duckduckgo https://duckduckgo.com/ duckduckgo is the best search engine for those who value their privacy as it doesn’t share it with others.  There is also an extension for chrome which replaces google.
